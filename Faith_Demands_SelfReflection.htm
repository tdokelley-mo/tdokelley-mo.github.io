<p class=MsoNormal>Last night was Week 4 in our current Wednesday night men’s
bible study session. We are walking through a study on developing right
thinking and a godly mindset. Our text for the lesson was Romans 12:2. The main
ideas were: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conformity
to the world’s way of thinking doesn’t line up with God’s plan for our
spiritual development</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Renewing
of the mind comes with pain, slow progress, and sometimes is difficult, but worth
pursuing</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>God’s
truth, as presented in the Bible, is the discernment tool to know “that good
and acceptable and perfect will of God”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As God would have it, I received my NIV Verse of the Day via
email this morning. Guess what it was? Not Romans 12:2, Romans 12:3, the very
next verse in that chapter. Paul writes this in Romans 12:3: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><sup><span style='font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></sup></i></b><i><span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black;background:white'><span
style='font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2;
text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial;
text-decoration-style: initial;text-decoration-color: initial;float:none;
word-spacing:0px'>For I say to every man that is among you, through the grace
given unto me, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but
to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</span>
21<sup>st</sup> Century King James Version </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what’s Paul getting at here? Well, in the micro-context
of verse 2 and 3, Paul is telling us to grow in God’s ways and thoughts. Renewing
of the mind reveals God’s character to us and it builds our faith. It molds our
thinking, it guides our actions, and it guards our tongues. That’s verse 2.
Then, in verse 3, Paul reminds us that God’s grace makes all this possible.
Paul, having received God’s grace, wants to pass along the exhortation against
boasting. Too often, we think we’ve arrived at some enlightenment or some truth
because we reasoned it out, we did the work, we, we, we…. You know what I mean!
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul says the opposite. The word used for “highly” in verse
3 means literally “to think more highly of one’s self than is proper”. That
sounds like excess, to me. Or extreme, we can go to extremes demonstrating how
well we are doing in our faith journey. Contrast that with Paul’s advice to
think soberly. It translates as being in one’s right mind, exercising
self-control, and putting a moderate estimate on yourself. Paul reminds us that
we need to reflect constantly on where we are spiritually. How are we doing
with, “<u>fill in the blank</u>”. It could be a sin issue, a relationship
issue, a pride issue, or even a biblical understanding issue. The key point is
we are hard at work! We are thinking rightly, and we are growing! Paul sums up
this verse with another reminder. Ultimately, God measures our faith. God has
given us a measure to work with for a time. We partner with the Holy Spirit and
consume that measure. When we do, God will measure out again, and again, and
again, until we are complete! Not here, but one day, in His presence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s some action steps:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Don’t
be afraid to reflect on your faith. Has it changed? Is that change good
progress or is it negative? If negative, find some wise brethren and seek their
counsel!</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Remember
to partner with the Holy Spirit. Reflect on the measure of faith given. Where
is it weak? Where is it strong? Pray to God to increase what is weak and make
the strong even stronger.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Take
a long look at your attitude regarding your faith. Are you boastful, are you
excessive? Pray God will help you examine your spiritual journey and your growing
faith in a humble spirit of partnership with God.</p>
